# Back-office access

People with a beBOP employee account and the super-admin can log in to the back office via /admin

## First-time login and secure access

As the /admin url is too obvious, the beBOP owner can configure a special string to secure access to the back office.

To do this, when you create beBOP, go to /admin/config, then to this area :

Once this has been done, access will be possible via the url /admin-chaineconfiguree/login

Access to the wrong admin URL will redirect to this page:

An employee with read/write access to /admin/arm can send you a password reset link, which contains the URL including /admins-secret

When a user is logged in, the /admin url automatically redirects to the correct link.

## Employee login

The employee login form is located at /admin-secret/login

You can extend the initial session timeout at the connection :

You will then have access to the admin area, depending on the rights assigned to your role:
- if you have read/write rights, the sub-menu link is normal
- if you have read-only rights, the sub-menu link is in italic (any action on the page will be refused)
- if you don't have read-only rights, the sub-menu link will be hidden, and an attempt to access it by direct url will send you back to the admin's homepage.

### Password security

During employee.e login, your password is checked.
The first and last encrypted characters of your password string are sent to [Have I Been Pawned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), which returns a series of whole strings.
beBOP then checks locally whether your password is present in this list (so that it is not communicated directly to Have I Been Pawned).
If the password is present, you'll be blocked with this security message, inviting you to change your password:

## Log out of the back office

You can log out by clicking on the red icon next to the "Admin" label in the header.

You will then be redirect back to the login page.

## Password recovery

If you lose your password, you can go to /admin-secret/login and click on "Recovery" :

You will then be prompted to enter your login.

If you enter the wrong identifier, you'll be notified, and you can try again with a different one. If you can't find your identifier, you'll have to ask the beBOP administrator to give you the information again.

In the event of abuse by an employee, protection will be triggered:

If the login exists, this message is sent to the contact address linked to the account (email, npub, or both):

![image](https://github.com/B2Bitcoin/beBOP/assets/50206014/58ac0240-f729-4075-9e9a-3b60a68476e7)

Using an expired or already-used link will take you back to an error page:

![image](https://github.com/B2Bitcoin/beBOP/assets/50206014/d5477b08-1909-47d2-8c95-7adc1d517ea3)

This link contains a one-time use token that sends you to the password reset page.

If the password you enter is too short, this block will be displayed:

![image](https://github.com/B2Bitcoin/beBOP/assets/50206014/d04feace-1751-4587-83c0-7cdced828cd4)

If the password is detected on Have I Been Pwned, this lock will be displayed:

![image](https://github.com/B2Bitcoin/beBOP/assets/50206014/cc5b31e5-097e-4aa0-b529-a13643fcb39d)

If the password is valid, you are redirected to the login page and can now log in with it.
