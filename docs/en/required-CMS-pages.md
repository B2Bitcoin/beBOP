## /why-vat-customs - Payment to customs on receipt
See [VAT-configuration.md](/docs/en/VAT-configuration.md)
Under the 2B VAT regime (sale at the VAT rate of the seller's country and exemption for the delivery of physical items abroad), the customer must validate a new mandatory option: I understand that I will have to pay VAT upon delivery. This option links to the CMS /why-vat-customs page, which must be created and completed to explain why your customer must pay VAT in their country upon receipt of your item.

## /why-collect-ip - Justification for collecting IP
See [privacy-management.md](/docs/en/privacy-management.md)
If, for accounting or legal reasons, you need to store your customer's IP address for a dematerialized purchase without a postal address (via /admin/config with the **Request IP collection on deliveryless order** option), the customer will be given a mandatory option to complete the order **I agree to the collection of my IP address (why?)**.
The link for this option goes to /why-collect-ip , where it's best to explain why you want to save such data (remembering that customer acceptance is mandatory to finalize the order if you configure your beBOP in this way).

## /why-pay-reminder - Commitment to pay an order on account
See [order-with-deposit.md](/doc/en/order-with-deposit.md)
When you activate payment on account for one of your items, the first order placed includes only the deposit, but the customer undertakes to pay the seller the remainder of the order amount under the conditions presented.
If your order includes a reservation for an item on account, the link is displayed in the checkout tunnel with the compulsory checkbox **I agree that I need to pay the remainder in the future (why?)**.
