# FAQ

## What is beBOP ?
- beBOP is a community monetization solution, free and open source (AGPLv3 license).
- beBOP presents itself as a solution capable of managing both :
  - e-commerce
  - in-store checkout
- beBOP allows, within the same shopping cart :
  - the sale of physical items
  - the sale of digital items
  - management of pay-what-you-want / name-your-price items, with or without a fixed minimum price
  - collect donations
  - periodic subscriptions
  while managing "peerfunding" challenges (such as Kickstarter or Ulule fundraising, without third parties).
- beBOP is a standalone solution (without plug-ins), requiring no specific development, to offer all privately and publicly funded developments to all content creators.
- beBOP natively includes Bitcoin and Lightning payments with no intermediate layer
- - beBOP natively includes Nostr features (light client admin, Nostr-bot creation, auto-certify and passwordless connection via Nostr temporary link)

## Why not BTCPayServer or LnBits?
We remain very respectful of the work carried out by the BTCPay teams, their seniority and their possible connectivity to existing online sales solutions.
We admire the work of the LNbits teams and their 100% privacy philosophy.
Each solution has its own strengths, values and potential clientele.
beBOP, on the other hand, is a solution created by content creators, who for years have had to contend with WooCommerces, Prestashop, Kickstarters, Ulule, Patreon, UTip, banking censorship and accounting problems.
So, beBOP is not a new Bitcoin or Lightning cash solution: beBOP is above all an accessible, law-abiding online and in-store sales system based on Bitcoin, Lightning and Nostr technologies.
If our core target is content creators, their core target is everyone: that's why we don't limit cashouts to Bitcoin and Lightning, why we natively integrate certain Fiat payments, and why we make sure that their year-end accounting can be done without a hitch, or any legal problems.
We want to offer beBOP as an e-commerce solution that's easy to learn and configure, so you can sell legally in an ecosystem of free software.
