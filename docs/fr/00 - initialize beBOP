# Initialize your beBOP

Quick dirty summary before cleaner documentation

Once your bebop is up :

## Super-admin account

- Go to your-site/admin/login
- create your superadmin account & password

## admin/config

### Protect your back-office access

Go to /admin/config, go to "Admin hash", define a hash, and save.
Now, the backoffice address is /admin-yourhash

### Make your beBOP into maintenance mode

Go to /admin/config, check "Enable maintenance mode".
You can an any IPv4 comma-separated to allow access to the front-office.
The back-office will always be open.

### Define your currencies
Go to /admin/config :
- main currency is used to be displayed on front & invoices
- second currency is optional and is used to be displayed on front
- price reference currency is the default currency you'll create your price on, but you'll be able to change that product per product
  - by clicking the red button and confirming, your product currencies will be overwritten to the chosen selection, but the price won't be updated
- accounting currency allows for full BTC currency beBOp to save the exchange rate of Bitcoin at the time of the order.

### Timing

Subscription duration is used for subscription product, you can choose month, week or day.
Subscription reminder is the delay between the sent of the new invoice proposal and the and of the subscription.

### Confirmation blocks

For Bitcoin on-chain payments, you can either define a standard number of verification for transaction.
But with "Manage confirmation thresholds", you'll be able to do that depending of the price, for example :
- < 100€ : 0 confirmation
- 100€ to 1000€ : 1 confirmation
- 1000€ to 9999999999999€ : 2 confirmations
etc

### Order expiration

"Set desired timeout for payment (in minute)" allows to cancel an order on beBOP system if the transaction wasn't paid or verified enough.
It's only for Bitcoin-onchain, Lightning and Credit card by sum up.
A too short time will oblige you to have short / null onchain confirmation block target.
A too long time will block your products stock while the order is pending.

### Stock reservation
To avoid stock squatting, you can set "How much time a cart reserves the stock (in minutes)".
When I add a product to my cart, if it's the last, no one will be able to.
But, if I don't process my order and if I wait more than the define time, the product will be available again, and removed from my basket if someone else buys it.

### TBD
